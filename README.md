### Specification:

In this project, I used a combination of the Django framework, Python, CSS, HTML, and Javascript to create a web application. This application takes the users' input of a unit of measurement and converts it into a different measurement unit. The application converts the weight in pounds or kilograms and converts them automatically to the unused variable. It also takes the length and converts it between miles and kilometers, and the temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius. Only users who sign up for the application or log in to a previously created account can access the calculator functions. Once the user signs up, their information is stored in a database where the administrator can view the user's data.
